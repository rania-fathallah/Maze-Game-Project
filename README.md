# 3D Raycasting Game

## Introduction

Welcome to the **3D Raycasting Game** project! This project aims to create an engaging 3D game using raycasting techniques, inspired by classic first-person shooters. Players will navigate through a dynamically rendered environment, featuring walls, movement mechanics, collision detection, and a map parser.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- GCC version 4.8.4
- SDL2 library

### Steps to Install

1. Update your package list and install SDL2:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
   ```

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. Compile the project using the Makefile:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Usage

To run the game, execute the compiled binary with the path to your map file:
```bash
./your_game_executable <path-to-map-file>
```

You can navigate through the game using the following controls:
- **W**: Move forward
- **A**: Move left
- **S**: Move backward
- **D**: Move right
- **Arrow Keys / Mouse**: Rotate the camera

## Features

1. **Walls Rendering**:
   - Create a window using SDL2.
   - Render walls using raycasting.
   - Differentiate wall colors from the ground/ceiling.

2. **Orientation**:
   - Change wall colors based on their orientation (NORTH/SOUTH vs. EAST/WEST).

3. **Camera Rotation**:
   - Implement camera rotation using keyboard or mouse input.

4. **Camera Movement**:
   - Enable camera movement using WASD keys.

5. **Collision Detection**:
   - Handle player-wall collisions, allowing the player to slide along walls.

6. **Map Parser**:
   - Implement a parser to read the map from a file.
   - Define custom standards for the map (characters for walls and empty spaces, file extension, etc.).
   - The program requires a parameter for the map file path upon execution.

7. **Map Drawing**:
   - Draw the parsed map on the window.
   - Provide the ability to enable/disable map rendering during execution.
   - Include the playerâ€™s line of sight in the map rendering.


## Structure
